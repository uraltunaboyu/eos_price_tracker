This is a cost calculator for Elder Scrolls Online. 

Simply point it to your installation of Tamriel Trade Center (to the `ItemLookUpTable_EN.lua` and `PriceTableNA.lua`) files,
and it will update the `ESO_Crafting_Cost_Calculator.xlsx` file, moving the untouched version to
`ESO_Crafting_Cost_Calculator_old.xlsx`.
